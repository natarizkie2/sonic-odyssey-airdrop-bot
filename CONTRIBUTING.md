# Explanation on How to Contribute

Thank you for being interested in contributing to this project! I really appreciate contributions, be it in the form of bug reports, feature requests, or Pull Requests to improve or add new features. This project is far from perfect, and I believe with the help of the community, we can make it better. Feel free to make changes and submit Pull Requests.

Since this is an open source project that I developed myself, there are still many features that can be improved or added. Any input or contribution from you is very valuable and will greatly help in improving the quality of this project. Thank you very much for your support!

## Steps To Contribute

* Fork it ( https://github.com/natarizkie2/sonic-odyssey-airdrop-bot )
* Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
* Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add some new feature'`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
* Create a new Pull Request

## Notes To Contribute

Make sure to not commit generated files from your dist folder. All changes need to be made in the source files located in the `src` folder.

* Change the `scss` files to adapt styles
* Change the nunjucks based `html` files or the content defining `json` files to adapt layout and content
* Change the `js` files to adapt the application code

Always run a build and test the results before committing.
